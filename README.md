Phishing URL Detection System — Project Description

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats, tricking users into revealing sensitive information through malicious links. This project focuses on building an intelligent Phishing URL Detection System that can accurately identify and classify URLs as legitimate or phishing using machine learning techniques.

The system analyzes multiple URL-based features such as length, presence of special characters, use of IP addresses, domain structure, and suspicious keywords. By training a machine learning model on real-world datasets, the application learns patterns commonly associated with phishing attempts and provides fast, reliable predictions.

This solution helps enhance online safety by alerting users before they interact with harmful links, making it useful for browsers, email filters, and cybersecurity tools.
